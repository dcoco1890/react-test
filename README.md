### Local

#### `yarn`

You can also clone this repo and run it locally. Start by navigating to your newly cloned directory and just running yarn. This will download all the dependencies needed

#### `yarn start`

Once yarn has finished, run yarn start. This should open a new tab in your preferred browser on localhost:3000. From there you can make changes to the code with your favorite code editor and see them change in real time. If it doesn't open a tab just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your own.
